trollBot
========

A twisted IRC bot written in python. Hopefully this will end up being very easy to use and will support TLS. This is GPL v3 licenced.

# Usage:
You will need python 2.7 and the twisted networking stuff. See https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/.

Copy trollBot.yaml.example to trollBot.yaml and edit it to include the login details of the IRC server and channel which you would like to use.

Finally run trollBot.py.
